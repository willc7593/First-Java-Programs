# First-Java-Programs
## Winter 2020 - Spring 2021
Some of my very first few Java programs when I was learning in highschool that I look back on fondly. Some very rudementary uses of prompting, loops, and nested arrays.

Based on guidelines given in class (some topics are very random), but I was encouraged to use my imagination, research new functions and techniques, and add as much as I wanted, so the programs ended up being above and beyond what was neccessary.
