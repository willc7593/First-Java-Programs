# First-Java-Programs
## Winter 2020/2021
Some of my very first few Java programs when I was learning in highschool that I look back on fondly. Very rudementary uses of prompting, loops, and nested arrays.

Based on guidelines given in class (some topics are very random), but I was encouraged to use my imagination, research new functions and techniques, and add as much as I wanted, so the programs ended up being above and beyond what was neccessary.

My personal favorite is Android.java. It was my first attempt at a game, and I think it's still surprisingly balanced. The activation code is: 8675309
